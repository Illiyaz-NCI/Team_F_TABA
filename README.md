This is a repository where Programming for AI module, Team F project files are uploaded.

We are working on ML algorthim based stock price trends analysis and stock predictions. 
All the coding is done using python and executed in jupyter notebook in VS-Code There are 4 different files, each team member worked on different datasets. 
And 4 jupyter notebook files will be present in the folders.

To run these scripts, some of the dependencies needs to be installed, so install the "requirements.txt" file. i.e. "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Once the requirements are installed, we are good to go. Just download the repo, and it has different folders with each team members name. Each folder has the dataset on which student has worked,
the jupyter code file(ipynb), and student journal.

Run all the cells one by one and results and graphs will be displayed. Also, once the execution is completed, a new csv file will be saved in the same location which has the predicted report obtained from prophet model.
